                        <strong>Winning Multipliers:</strong> Each segment of the wheel has a multiplier (e.g., x0.5, x1.00, x2.00).
                        If the wheel lands on a segment, the corresponding multiplier will determine your winnings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Results:</strong> The winning multiplier will be applied to your bet amount. Your balance will
                        be updated with your winnings or deductions.
                    </li>

                        <strong>Repeat:</strong> You can keep spinning as long as you have enough funds in your account.
